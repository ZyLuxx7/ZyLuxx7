---

## 🛠 Requirements

- ✅ Windows OS with PowerShell 5.1+  
- 🌍 Internet connection  
- 🔐 Serveo (public SSH reverse tunneling)

---

## ⚙️ How it works

1. Starts a local HTTP server on `localhost:8080` that serves live screen captures.
2. Opens a public Serveo tunnel using:
   ```bash
   ssh -R 80:localhost:8080 serveo.net
   
🧪 Quick Install (qinstall)

Run this one-liner in PowerShell (as Administrator) to start sharing immediately:
```bash
iwr -useb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZyLuxx7/ZyLuxx7/main/LiveScreenServeo/start-liveshare.ps1" | iex
```
After a few seconds, a terminal will open showing your public URL (e.g., https://yourname.serveo.net).
Open it in any browser to view your live screen(s).

❌ Quick Uninstall (qdelete)

To stop the screen share and clean up (background server + SSH tunnel), run:
```bash
iwr -useb "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZyLuxx7/ZyLuxx7/main/LiveScreenServeo/stop-liveshare.ps1" | iex
```
This will close any background listener and kill the Serveo tunnel process.
